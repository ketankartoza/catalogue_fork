=====================
Testing the Catalogue
=====================

Quickstart
----------

The catalogue is provided with a test suite. You can run it like this::
   
   ./runtests.sh


Testing overview
----------------

Two kinds of tests are provided:

- DocTests ([see http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/nov/2/introduction-pythondjango-testing-doctests/])
- UnitTests ([see http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/nov/4/introduction-pythondjango-testing-basic-unit-tests/ ])
-

For simple tests, you can edit catalogue/tests/simple_tests.py and add additional tests, or add additional files 
containing doctests. Each test file you create must be registered in catalogue/tests/__init__.py.

To power the tests, various fixtures have been created in catalogue/fixtures which will be loaded in the 
test database each time you run the tests. For more info on generating fixtures, [see http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/nov/5/introduction-pythondjango-testing-fixtures/].

Creating Fixtures
-----------------

Here is the procedure followed to create fixtures for testing:

**Note:** This is a once off exercise and is probably not needed as the
fixtures generated now reside in git. The procedure is noted here in case it
ever needs to be repeated::

   pg_dump -Fc -f sac-test-20June2011.dmp sac
   createdb sac-test
   pg_restore sac-test-20June2011.dmp | psql sac-test
   psql sac-test


Now run the following sequence of commands to flush all the data from the db
and keep only dictionaries etc.

**Note:** Be very careful not to run this on any live database!

```
delete from catalogue_radarproduct;
delete from catalogue_searchrecord;
delete from catalogue_orderstatushistory;
delete from catalogue_orderstatus;
delete from catalogue_taskingrequest;
delete from catalogue_order cascade;
delete from catalogue_orderstatus;
delete from catalogue_opticalproduct;
delete from catalogue_genericproduct;
delete from catalogue_taskingrequest;
delete from catalogue_searchrecord;
delete from catalogue_visit;
delete from catalogue_clip;
delete from catalogue_genericimageryproduct;
delete from catalogue_search_processing_level;
delete from catalogue_search_sensors;
delete from catalogue_searchdaterange;
delete from catalogue_search;
drop table heatmap_grid;
drop table heatmap_grid cascade;
delete from catalogue_sacuserprofile;
delete from userprofile_emailvalidation;
delete from catalogue_deliverydetail;
delete from catalogue_ordernotificationrecipients_sensors;
delete from catalogue_ordernotificationrecipients;
delete from userprofile_avatar;
delete from catalogue_ordernotificationrecipients;
delete from django_admin_log;
delete from auth_user where username != 'timlinux';
delete from catalogue_genericsensorproduct;
delete from catalogue_genericproduct;
drop table catalogue_clip;
drop table import.sumb;
drop table import.spot5;
drop table import.sacc;
drop table import.cbers;

vacuum analyze;

```

Next you should tweak your settings.py to point to sac-test and then do:

```
python manage.py syncdb

```


Now generate the fixtures like this:

```
mkdir catalogue/fixtures
python manage.py dumpdata catalogue --format=json --indent=4 > \
catalogue/fixtures/catalogue.json
`````````````````````````````````

Finally throw away your temporary database and reinstate your settings.py to use the 
normal production database.

```````````````
dropdb sac-test
```````````````

Running unit tests
------------------

A settings file for tests is available as `settings_test.py` this settings
use the faster spatialite instead of createdb.

.. note:: You must enable the virtual environment first!

`````````````````````````````
source ../python/bin/activate
`````````````````````````````

Running unit tests using SQLITE backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can run the tests, you need to make sure you have pysqlite installed:

````````````````````
pip install pysqlite
````````````````````

It should have been installed during the system setup process already.


Run tests for catalogue app as:

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
$ python manage.py test catalogue --settings=settings_test
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Running Unit tests using Postgresql
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively you can use postgresql as the test database backend. Before you
can run the tests you should create a template database and set some
permissions on it:

```
createdb template_postgis
psql template_postgis
GRANT ALL ON geometry_columns TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;
\q
``

Now you can run the tests without the settings_test option and they will be
executed against an autogenerated PostgreSQL database backend.

```````````````````````````````
python manage.py test catalogue
```````````````````````````````
