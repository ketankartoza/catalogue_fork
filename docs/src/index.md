The SANSA Catalogue is the window for the users of satellite imagery archived and processed at SANSA Earth Observation to search and request imagery for use by Government Departments, Academic and Research Institutions, as well as private companies or individuals. The importance of the efficient operation of this system is vital to the public face of SANSA and to our service delivery of the products we produce. The catalogue is the tool used by Customer Services in the Data Products and Services group (DPS) of Earth Observation to monitor Orders and produce statistical reports for management. 

## Key concepts

<!-- A **project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of SANSA Catalogue. Projects
combine different elements (Reference datasets, indicators, and context layers)
and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users.

**Context layers** are geospatial layers used to contextualise the information presented in a project.

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets harvested by the platform.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data. -->

The SANSA Catalogue's key feature is the project dashboard, which integrates reference datasets, indicators, and context layers for data visualization and analysis. Context layers provide geospatial context, while indicator layers are derived from spreadsheets or other intelligence sources. Widgets are visual components, such as charts, created through data analysis at country or regional levels.
